# The Apple Sample Apps Repository

Welcome to our Apple Sample Apps repository. This repository includes executable code samples as well as full applications, which are meant to exemplify how our iOS/OSX SDK is used and how you could incorporate it in your iOS/OSX projects. 

The repository includes two sub folders: 

+ **code-samples** 
+ **complete-apps** 

The `code-samples` folder includes simple to use executable code snippets showcasing a number of SDK features. The `complete-apps` folder includes step by step tutorials displaying how to build a complete application using the SDK.

To get a good overview of the content of this repository, open the master branch on your *XCode Workspace* and take a look at both sub folders. For the complete applications, select the relevant sub folder and have a look at the README available for each individual app.

Happy coding!
